# StreamRoot

Exercice Streamroot :

1- For this exercise I used Python (version 2 .7).  I used the pandas library for the data frame manipulation and matplotlib and seabron for the data visualization part. I focused all my work on one single Jupyter Notebook that provides an interactive environement for visualization of plots. ( You will find this notebook in the github under the name Streamroot.ipynb)

First, I printed out the dataframe and started exploring it. Two different tools were useful to extract knowledge from the data and identify simple patterns in the data :
•	The first one is the the seaborn object seaborn.countplot that counts the number of instances with respect to one attribute of the dataframe and displays it in a histogram. Since each line refers to a unique user that can have a different isp, brower or stream number, this was a very useful tool to visualize the distribution of the users in different conditions.
•	Metrics and percentages.

I - GENRAL ANALYSIS :

In this first part, I split the data in subset and visualized it. Visualizing the data early was useful  to me, as it allows me to get a sense of the data, and gives me ideas  for more complex analysis.
